At Booz Allen, we built an industry-leading team of  \\nData Scientists. Over the course of hundreds of analytic \\nchallenges for dozens of clients, we’ve unraveled the DNA of \\nData Science.

But there are some signi/f_icant diﬀerences – \\nparticularly with respect to the question of who stores, maintains and \\nowns the data in an organization.\\nBut before we go there, lets look at what is changing. Traditionally, \\nrigid data silos arti/f_icially de/f_ine the data to be acquired. Stated \\nanother way, the silos create a /f_ilter that lets in a very small amount of \\ndata and ignores the rest. /T_hese /f_iltered processes give us an arti/f_icial \\nview of the world based on the ‘surviving data,’ rather than one that \\nshows full reality and meaning. Without a broad and expansive data \\nset, we can never immerse ourselves in the diversity of the data. We \\ninstead make decisions based on limited and constrained information. \\nEliminating the need for silos gives us access to all the data at once – \\nincluding data from multiple outside sources. It embraces the reality \\nthat diversity is good and complexity is okay . /T_his mindset creates a \\ncompletely diﬀerent way of thinking about data in an organization by \\ngiving it a new and diﬀerentiated role.

We can’t leave you with anything \\nmore than general guidance to help ensure maximum value: \\n\\x03›Look inside /f_irst: What data do you have current access  \\nto that you are not using? /T_his is in large part the data  \\nbeing left behind by the /f_iltering process, and may be \\nincredibly valuable.\\n\\x03›Remove the format constraints: Stop limiting your data \\nacquisition mindset to the realm of structured databases. \\nInstead, think about unstructured and semi-structured data \\nas viable sources.\\n\\x03›Figure out what’s missing: Ask yourself what data would \\nmake a big diﬀerence to your processes if you had access to it. \\n/T_hen go /f_ind it!\\n\\x03›Embrace diversity: Try to engage and connect to publicly \\navailable sources of data that may have relevance to your \\ndomain area.  » Not All Data Is Created Equal\\nAs you begin to aggregate data, \\nremember that not all data is  \\ncreated equally. Organizations have  \\na tendency to collect any data that  \\nis available. Data that is nearby \\n(readily accessible and easily \\nobtained) may be cheap to collect, \\nbut there is no guarantee it is the \\nright data to collect.

In statistics \\nthis is referred to as Type I error. \\nAs scientists, we are always \\non the lookout for a new or \\ninteresting breakthrough that \\ncould explain a phenomenon. \\nWe hope to see a pattern in our \\ndata that explains something \\nor that can give us an answer. \\nThe primary goal of hypothesis \\ntesting is to limit Type I error. \\nThis is accomplished by using \\nsmall Į values. For example, \\na Į value of 0.05 states that \\nthere is a 1 in 20 chance that \\nthe test will show that there \\nis something signiﬁcant when \\nin actuality there isn’t. This \\nproblem compounds when \\ntesting multiple hypotheses. \\nWhen running multiple \\nhypothesis tests, we are likely \\nto encounter Type I error. As \\nmore data becomes available \\nfor analysis, Type I error \\nneeds to be controlled. \\nOne of my projects required \\ntesting the difference between \\nthe means of two microarray \\ndata samples. Microarray \\ndata contains thousands of \\nmeasurements but is limited \\nin the number of observations. \\nA common analysis approach \\nis to measure the same genes \\nunder different conditions. If \\nthere is a signiﬁcant enough \\ndifference in the amount of \\ngene expression between the \\ntwo samples, we can say that \\nthe gene is correlated with a \\nparticular phenotype. One way \\nto do this is to take the mean of \\neach phenotype for a particular gene and formulate a hypothesis \\nto test whether there is a \\nsigniﬁcant difference between \\nthe means. Given that we were \\nrunning thousands of these tests \\nat Į = 0.05, we found several \\ndifferences that were signiﬁcant. \\nThe problem was that some \\nof these could be caused by \\nrandom chance. \\nMany corrections exist to \\ncontrol for false indications of \\nsigniﬁcance. The Bonferroni \\ncorrection is one of the most \\nconservative. This calculation \\nlowers the level below which you \\nwill reject the null hypothesis \\n(your p value). The formula is \\nalpha/n , where n equals the \\nnumber of hypothesis tests \\nthat you are running. Thus, if \\nyou were to run 1,000 tests of \\nsigniﬁcance at Į\\x03= 0.05, your \\np value should be less than \\n0.00005 (0.05/1,000) to reject the \\nnull hypothesis. This is obviously \\na much more stringent value.  \\nA large number of the previously \\nsigniﬁcant values were no longer \\nsigniﬁcant, revealing the true \\nrelationships within the data.\\nThe corrected signiﬁcance gave \\nus conﬁdence that the observed \\nexpression levels were due to \\ndifferences in the cellular gene \\nexpression rather than noise. We \\nwere able to use this information \\nto begin investigating what \\nproteins and pathways were \\nactive in the genes expressing \\nthe phenotype of interest.

Spoofed domains occur when a malicious actor  \\ncreates a website, URL or email address that users believe is \\nassociated with a valid organization. When users click the link,  \\nvisit the website or receive emails, they are subjected to some  \\ntype of nefarious activity.\\nOur team was faced with the problem of \\nidentifying spoofed domains for a commercial \\ncompany. On the surface, the problem sounded \\neasy; take a recently registered domain, check \\nto see if it is similar to the company’s domain \\nand alert when the similarity is sufﬁciently high. \\nUpon decomposing the problem, however, the \\nmain computation quickly became complicated.\\nWe needed a computation that determined \\nsimilarity between two domains. As we \\ndecomposed the similarity computation, \\ncomplexity and speed became a concern.  \\nAs with many security-related problems, fast alert speeds are vital. Result speed created \\nan implementation constraint that forced us to \\nre-evaluate how we decomposed the problem.\\nRevisiting the decomposition process led us \\nto a completely new approach. In the end, \\nwe derived a list of domains similar to those \\nregistered by the company. We then compared \\nthat list against a list of recently registered \\ndomains. The ﬁgure, Spoofed Domain Problem \\nDecomposition,  illustrates our approach. Upon \\ntesting and initial deployment, our analytic \\ndiscovered a spoofed domain within 48 hours.  /guilsinglright.cap/guilsinglright.cap\\nSpoofed Domain Problem Decomposition Source: Booz Allen Hamilton \\n61 Take off the Training Wheels', metadata={'source': '/content/The-Field-Guide-to-Data-Science.pdf', 'page': 61}),\n",

As soon as  \\none dimension is /f_ixed, the Data Scientist is forced to make trades \\namong the others. For example, if the analytic problem requires \\nactions to be produced in near real-time, the speed dimension is  \\n/f_ixed and trades must be made among the other four dimensions. \\nUnderstanding which trades will achieve the right balance among  \\nthe /f_ive dimensions is an art that must be learned over time.As we compiled this section, we \\ntalked extensively about ways to \\ngroup and classify implementation \\nconstraints.

Finally, \\nthe model is evaluated on the validation data to assess how well the \\nmodel generalizes.\\nA few methods where the data is split into training and testing sets \\ninclude: k-fold cross-validation, Leave-One-Out cross-validation, \\nbootstrap methods, and resampling methods. Leave-One-Out cross-\\nvalidation can be used to get a sense of ideal model performance \\nover the training set.

There was a huge \\nopportunity if the client could make sense of this data. Reducing the \\nvariance and improving the product yield by even a small amount \\ncould result in signiﬁcant cost savings.\\nOur Solution\\nDue to the size and complexity of \\nthe process data, prior analysis \\nefforts that focused on data \\nfrom only a single sub-process \\nhad limited success.
